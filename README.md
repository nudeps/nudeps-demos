# Nudeps Demo

A demo repository to showcase how nudeps works.

## How to try out locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nudeps/nudeps-demo.git && cd nudeps-demo && npm install
```

That's it!
Then, start a local server and open the index.html file in your browser.

You can try installing and uninstalling dependencies as needed, and see how the import map gets updated.
